Controller: Java file that holds the endpoints
Endpoints are methods that are mapped to a URL
When this URL is called from the outside, the method is executed

From within the controller, we call the service for business logic
In the service, we deal with any specific requirements
In the service, we use the repository as a datasource / dao
The repository is automagically created when it extends the correct interface
